Deadline: 15 Nov 2024.\nProject Summary We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to work on an exciting multidisciplinary project funded by the Danish Council for Independent Research (Sapere Aude), aiming to develop cutting-edge tools to understand complex plant responses to environmental variables.\nProject Description Context Plants live in complex environments, responding to factors such as light, temperature, and nutrients, which affect their growth and survival. Each plant responds differently to these factors, and understanding these reactions is key to studying their ability to adapt and thrive in various conditions. This project aims to take a groundbreaking approach by not just studying plants in isolated environments, but by exploring how they grow across a multidimentional range of environmental conditions in real-time.\nAbout The Project The project focuses on characterising “response surfaces” in the small, fast-growing plant species Lemna gibba (duckweed), using high-throughput phenotyping and advanced AI tools. The core of the research involves: • Development and validation of DWARPH (DuckWeed Automatic Robot for Phenomics), a scalable, miniature growth chamber with automated real-time phenotyping. • Application of deep learning and optimisation theory to iteratively explore how environmental factors influence plant growth. • Comparative analysis of genetic determinants of plant plasticity and ecological niche modelling across multiple L. gibba ecotypes. This research will explore exciting questions about plant adaptation, response surface modeling, and experimental metaphenomics, providing valuable insights into plant biology and the future of sustainable agriculture.\nResearch Group You will join the dynamic Digital Approaches for Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture (DARSA) group, at the Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG). The group and center foster a dynamic, inclusive and multidisciplinary environment. Your research will take place at Aarhus University, a prestigious institution located in a vibrant student-friendly city. This project will be conducted with local (the Aquatic Biology Section) and international (Dr. Ryan Sartor) collaborators.\nSelection Process Candidates will be evaluated based on their CV, motivation statement, and reference letters. Shortlisted candidates will be invited for an interview (online or in person). The top candidate will be offered the position.\nWhy Apply?

Deadline: 31 August 2024.\nProject Summary Start an innovative PhD focused on developing high-throughput methods using cameras and computer vision to explore the hidden world of earthworm-plant interactions. Earthworms play a crucial ecological role, and this pioneering approach aims to uncover their interactions with plant roots. This project is the first phase of a comprehensive 5-year initiative employing advanced technologies (imaging, acoustics, deep learning, remote sensing, etc.) to enhance our understanding of earthworms.\nProject Description Context Soil health is the foundation of our food systems, yet we are losing it at an alarming rate due to our land use. To combat this, we must shift from extractive to restorative, circular agriculture. This paradigm shift requires extensive research on decomposers, particularly earthworms. Earthworms are essential for soil health due to their ubiquity and biomass, but their subterranean lifestyle poses significant observational challenges. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning offer a unique opportunity to study these elusive organisms.\nOutcomes As a successful applicant, you will develop “The Wormitron,” an innovative, open-source hardware system featuring cameras and 2D-terrariums to image earthworms and plant roots continuously under semi-controlled conditions. You will test hypotheses on the nature, timing, and implications (both physiological and evolutionary) of earthworm-root interactions. This project promises direct applications for sustainable agriculture and a profound understanding of these hidden ecosystem engineers.\nResearch Group The successful student will be integrated the growing Digital Approaches for Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture (DARSA) group, started in 2022, at the Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG). Both the group and the centre are inclusive and multidisciplinary environments with a range of local and international collaborations. The research takes place at Aarhus University, a world-leading institution located in a vibrant city.\nApplicant’s Profile and Eligibility We believe that diversity makes us better at tackling complex problems.

However, agriculture, urban expansion and climate-change-induced desertification are leading to an almost irreversible, alarming and large-scale soil loss. As part of our green transition, farming must become less extractive, more restorative and circular. This change of paradigm must translate into much more research on the processes and organisms, such as decomposers, that enact circularity – which have hitherto been severely understudied. Amongst them, earthworms (EWs), with their unmatched ubiquity and biomass, are pivotal actors. However, these cryptic animals live below ground, making their study a methodological challenge. As a result, we know poorly the behaviour of EWs, their relationships with plants, and their importance in agriculture. With recent technological leaps, we have unprecedented opportunities to open the EW black box. This project aims to develop unique and novel tools to study EWs in agroecological contexts. Using remote sensing and artificial intelligence, we address three difficult tasks that have, so far, hindered EW research: high-throughput species identification, automatic behavioural analysis, and real-time activity monitoring in the field. Throughout, we use these tools to understand how plants, in particular cover crops (a major soil protection tool), and EWs interact.\n","date":1701129600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701129600,"objectID":"593225d34a42da809374c226deb2e107","permalink":"https://darsa.info/project/global-worming/","publishdate":"2023-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/global-worming/","section":"project","summary":"Monitoring earthworms with AI and remote sensing","tags":["software","hardware","agroecology","deep-learning","ongoing"],"title":"Global Worming","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"2db8891a14607de739dd9f8cf67248d6","permalink":"https://darsa.info/collaborators/insectai/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/collaborators/insectai/","section":"collaborators","summary":"COST Action network on Image-based AI for Insect Monitoring \u0026 Conservation","tags":null,"title":"InsectAI","type":"collaborators"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Custom Imaging Platform and Deep Learning to Identify and Phenotype Earthworms Open PhD Position Please also see the official posting. Deadline: 30 September 2023.\nProject Summary This exciting PhD opportunity aims at developing novel imaging methods and deep learning algorithms to describe and classify earthworms. Although cryptic, earthworms have considerable ecological importance, and this original approach will help understand and protect them. It is the first part of a larger 5-year project that uses novel technologies (imaging, acoustics, deep learning, remote sensing, etc) to monitor and understand earthworms better.\nProject Description Context Our food system ultimately rests on soils, which we are losing at an alarming rate. To counteract this trend, we need to transition from an extractive to a restorative and circular agriculture. This change of paradigm must come together with more research on the organisms, such as decomposers, that enact circularity – which have so far been severely understudied. Amongst these earthworms, with their unmatched ubiquity and biomass, are pivotal actors. However, these animals live below ground, making their study a methodological challenge: they are very difficult to observe and monitor. However, recent technological developments in remote sensing and deep learning represent an unprecedented opportunity to shed new light on these cryptic actors of circularity.\nOutcomes The successful applicant will create design a new acquisition platform to create a large dataset of standardized earthworm images. Based on these images, the PhD candidate will develop novel deep learning algorithms to model the “grammar of earthworm segments” and automatically classify earthworm species. In addition, this algorithm will explain the anatomy and texture of earthworms to reveal more cryptic traits and eventually study the important variables that affect earthworm diversity, anatomy and development. The prototype imaging and classification tools created during this project may transform the way we survey earthworms, towards a large amount of consistent data, and altogether, greatly facilitate our understanding of these animals as well as our conservation efforts.\nResearch Group The successful student will be integrated the growing Digital Approaches for Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture (DARSA) group, started in 2022, at the Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG). Both the group and the centre are inclusive and multidisciplinary environments with a range of local and international collaborations. The research takes place at Aarhus University, a world-leading institution located in a vibrant city.\nApplicant’s Profile and Eligibility We believe that diversity makes us better at tackling complex problems. Therefore, we strongly support applicants with a diverse background and are committed to promote inclusion and equity.\nOverall, we expect the applicant to:\nHold a Master’s degree in data science, mathematics, physics, engineering or another quantitative field Be at least familiar with hardware design, deep learning, image processing Have strong software and/or hardware engineering skills (in particular, experience working with scientific languages (e.g. Python) and packages (e.g. Pytorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas and OpenCV) Have a strong interest in biodiversity (in particular invertebrates) Be fluent in English (written and spoken) Demonstrate advanced collaborative and interpersonal skills Supervision Our primary goal is for our students to succeed by helping them to develop and achieve their career goals. As such, we support and help students in taking the project in their own direction, within the original scope, and encourage flexibility as well as new viewpoints as the project moves forward. The successful applicant should expect a weekly meeting with Quentin Geissmann, their direct supervisor. Students are encouraged to collaborate within and outside of the group, and will be given (funded) opportunities to present their research at international conferences. We also consider it the supervisor’s role to ensure students feel safe and included in their work environment.\nLocation and Facilities The research takes place in the QGG at Aarhus University (AU). AU is a world-class university (the largest in Denmark), with outstanding opportunities for collaboration on this particular project. For this project, we have access to various High-Performance Computing platforms and workstations, including GPUs. In addition to these computational resources, we have a workshop suitable to prototype hardware (cameras, edge computing, …) in-house, and have access to larger infrastructure through our collaborations with the engineering department.

If used appropriately, machine learning and AI have the potential to drive a digital green transition that could make agriculture more sustainable, resilient and productive.\nOne increasingly important data-science task in agriculture is image classification, which is crucial for detecting, monitoring, and eventually mitigating the impact of weeds, pests and diseases. When applied to agricultural problems, image classification generally suffers from three important limitations: 1. low generalisability – i.e., it translates poorly to new contexts –; 2. data-hunger – i.e., large training datasets are required –; and 3. the lack of accessible implementations for practitioners.\nAs an alternative to the conventional “flat” classification, we propose to take advantage of the underlying hierarchical taxonomies of the predicted classes to constrain them in a priori trees, a currently underexplored area. As a simplistic illustration, instead of considering oranges, apples and lemons as independent, we may formulate the explicit tree: {{orange, lemon}, apple}, i.e. grouping citrus fruits, and embed this representation in the structure of a neural network.\nOutcomes The successful applicant will use already available datasets to explore hierarchical classifications and test our hypotheses: increased prediction generalisability and network robustness as well as reducing the amount of data required. This project aims to produce both seminal machine-learning concepts and free and open-source tools for real-world problems.\nResearch Group The successful student will integrate the growing Digital Approaches for Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture (DARSA) group, started in 2022, at the Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG).
